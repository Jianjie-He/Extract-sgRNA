# Extract-sgRNA
 This is a Python script to extract the sgRNA sequences by decomposing the fastq files of amplicon-seq results with 6bp barcodes.
 The amplicon length is supposed to be 133-135bp (suppose that there are small insertions and/or deletions in sgRNAs of some transgenics).
 In the "combination.txt" file, the 6bp barcodes in forward and reverse primers are structured respectively in the first and second column; additionally, the third column indicates the well ID of each 96-well plates.
